# NLP_MathProblem  
Since it is an Industry-University Cooperation Project,  
no longer access to the dataset as the project ended :)  
 
Note the project was worked as a team,  
and I was mainly in charge of Text pre-processing / machine learning methods (XGBoost) / Ensembling / Result Analysis

#### Implementations:  
1. Processing dirty text  
2. Machine Learning methods to classify math word problems with equations (Korean + English + Math Symbols + Numbers)  
3. with the help of pretrained KoBert and KoELECTRA models, classification used with fine tuning
4. Ensembling  
5. Analysis of results: wrongs and rights
